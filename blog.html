        What Is a Smart Home?
         </h2>
         <div >   A smart home refers to a convenient home setup where appliances
         and devices can be automatically controlled remotely from anywhere
          with an internet connection using a mobile or other networked device. 
          Devices in a smart home are interconnected through the internet, allowing the user 
          to control functions such as security access to the home, temperature, lighting, 
          and a home theater remotely.

       How Smart Home Works? 
    </h2>
      A smart home’s devices are connected with each other and can be accessed
         through one central point—a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or game console. 
         Door locks, televisions, thermostats, home monitors, cameras, lights, 
         and even appliances such as the refrigerator can be controlled 
         through one home automation system. The system is installed on a mobile 
         or other networked device, 
         and the user can create time schedules for certain changes to take effect.
        Smart home appliances come with self-learning skills so they can learn the homeowner’s 
        schedules and make adjustments as needed. Smart homes enabled with lighting control allow 
        homeowners to reduce electricity use and benefit from energy-related cost savings. 
        Some home automation systems alert the homeowner if any motion is detected in the home
         when they're away, while others can call the authorities—police or the fire department—in 
         case of imminent situations.
        Once connected, services such as a smart doorbell, smart security system, 
        and smart appliances are all part of the internet of things (IoT) technology, 
        a network of physical objects that can gather and share electronic information.

        Advantages of Smart Homes
    </h2>
    Installing a smart home technology system provides homeowners with convenience. Rather than 
        controlling appliances, thermostats, lighting, and other features using different devices, 
        homeowners can control them all using one device—usually a smartphone or tablet.
        Since they're connected to a portable device, users can get notifications and updates on 
        issues in their homes. For instance, smart doorbells allow homeowners to see and communicate 
        with people who come to their doors even when they're not at home. Users can set and control 
        the internal temperature, lighting, and appliances as well.
        For the cost of setting up the smart system, homeowners can benefit from significant cost 
        savings. Appliances and electronics can be used more efficiently, lowering energy costs.
